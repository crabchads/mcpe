# Bevy MCPE

This is a WIP Minecraft: Pocket Edition 0.2.0 recreation written in Rust using the Bevy game engine.
You need the assets from the original game to play this. [You can get them from archive.org](https://archive.org/details/Minecraft-PE).
You'll also need the [improved Monocraft font](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft), placed in the `assets/font/Monocraft-SemiBold.otf`.
